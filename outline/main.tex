\section{Introduction to Regression (15 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Definition of regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
\item The method seeks to find the best-fitting line (or curve) that represents this relationship.
\end{itemize}

\item Importance of regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression analysis is important in a variety of fields such as finance, marketing, engineering, and social sciences.
\item It helps to understand the relationship between variables and can be used to make predictions or to inform decision-making.
\end{itemize}

\item Brief history of regression
\begin{itemize}
\item The concept of regression was first introduced by Sir Francis Galton in the late 19th century.
\item He used the method to study the relationship between the heights of fathers and sons.
\item Since then, regression analysis has been extensively studied and developed, and is now widely used in various fields.
\end{itemize}

\item Types of problems that can be solved using regression analysis
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression analysis can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as predicting stock prices, forecasting sales, analyzing the relationship between advertising spend and sales, and understanding the effect of education on income.
\end{itemize}

\item Applications of regression in various fields
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression analysis has wide applications in fields such as finance, marketing, healthcare, social sciences, and engineering.
\item It is used to understand and predict customer behavior, to forecast sales and revenues, to optimize manufacturing processes, and to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and health outcomes, among other things.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theoretical Background of Regression (30 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Basic concepts of regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
\item The method is used to estimate the parameters of a mathematical function that describes this relationship.
\item The function is used to make predictions or to understand the relationship between the variables.
\end{itemize}

\item Linear regression models and assumptions
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear regression models assume that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear.
\item The model is represented by a straight line equation, where the slope and intercept are estimated from the data.
\item The assumptions of linear regression include normality of errors, constant variance, and linearity of the relationship.
\end{itemize}

\item Nonlinear regression models and when to use them
\begin{itemize}
\item Nonlinear regression models allow for more complex relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
\item They can be used when the relationship between the variables is not linear or when the data exhibits a pattern that cannot be modeled using a linear equation.
\item Nonlinear regression models are used to fit curves, surfaces, or other complex functions to the data.
\end{itemize}

\item Different types of regression models
\begin{itemize}
\item There are various types of regression models, each with its own assumptions and applications.
\item Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two variables.
\item Multiple linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.
\item Polynomial regression is used to model nonlinear relationships by fitting a polynomial function to the data.
\item Logistic regression is used to model binary or categorical outcomes.
\item Time series regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and time.
\end{itemize}

\item Model selection criteria
\begin{itemize}
\item Model selection criteria are used to evaluate the performance of different regression models and to select the best model.
\item Some common model selection criteria include R-squared, adjusted R-squared, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
\item These criteria evaluate the goodness of fit of the model and balance the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Practical Use of Regression (30 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Data preparation and preprocessing
\begin{itemize}
\item The first step in using regression is to prepare and preprocess the data.
\item This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the variables if necessary.
\item Data preparation also involves selecting the variables that will be used in the regression model and checking for multicollinearity.
\end{itemize}

\item Model training and evaluation
\begin{itemize}
\item The next step is to train the regression model on the data.
\item This involves selecting the appropriate regression algorithm and tuning the model hyperparameters.
\item Once the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated on a test set to check its performance.
\item Model evaluation metrics include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
\end{itemize}

\item Feature selection and engineering
\begin{itemize}
\item Feature selection involves selecting the most relevant variables to include in the regression model.
\item Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve the model's performance.
\item Some techniques for feature selection and engineering include principal component analysis (PCA), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and polynomial features.
\end{itemize}

\item Regularization and overfitting
\begin{itemize}
\item Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting of the regression model.
\item Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the noise in the data instead of the underlying pattern.
\item Regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, which add penalties to the model coefficients to discourage overfitting.
\item Cross-validation is also used to evaluate the model's performance and to prevent overfitting.
\end{itemize}

\item Practical applications of regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, engineering, and social sciences.
\item Some practical applications of regression include predicting stock prices, estimating customer lifetime value, analyzing the impact of advertising on sales, and modeling the relationship between weather and crop yield.
\item Regression is also used in machine learning applications such as predicting housing prices, credit risk assessment, and image and speech recognition.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Intuition for Regression (30 minutes)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Identifying regression problems
\begin{itemize}
\item The first step in using regression is to identify when it can be applied to a problem.
\item Regression is used when there is a relationship between two or more variables, and we want to predict the value of one variable (the dependent variable) based on the values of the other variables (the independent variables).
\item Some examples of problems where regression can be applied include predicting housing prices based on features such as square footage and number of bedrooms, and predicting the weight of a person based on their height and age.
\end{itemize}

\item Types of regression problems
\begin{itemize}
\item There are different types of regression problems depending on the nature of the independent and dependent variables.
\item Simple linear regression is used when there is a linear relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable.
\item Multiple linear regression is used when there is a linear relationship between multiple independent variables and the dependent variable.
\item Polynomial regression is used when there is a curved relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
\item Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical.
\end{itemize}

\item The role of regression coefficients
\begin{itemize}
\item The regression coefficients represent the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
\item In simple linear regression, the coefficient represents the slope of the line.
\item In multiple linear regression, the coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant.
\item The coefficients can be used to interpret the relationship between the independent and dependent variables and to make predictions.
\end{itemize}

\item Limitations of regression
\begin{itemize}
\item While regression is a powerful tool, it has some limitations.
\item One limitation is that it assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, which may not be the case in all situations.
\item Another limitation is that it assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is constant across the range of the independent variables, which may not be true in all cases.
\item It is important to be aware of these limitations when using regression and to use other tools such as data visualization and exploratory data analysis to assess the relationship between variables.
\end{itemize}

\item Tips for using regression effectively
\begin{itemize}
\item To use regression effectively, it is important to have a good understanding of the data and the problem at hand.
\item It is also important to carefully select the independent variables and to preprocess the data appropriately.
\item Regularization techniques can be used to prevent overfitting and to improve the generalization of the model.
\item Finally, it is important to interpret the results of the regression analysis carefully and to use other tools such as data visualization and exploratory data analysis to validate the results.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bonus: Applying Regression to Real-World Problems (Never Ends)}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item Introduction
\begin{itemize}
\item In this section, we will briefly discuss two real-world problems where regression analysis can be applied: predicting stock prices and predicting housing prices.
\item Please note that this section is optional and not part of the main course material. If you are interested in learning more about these topics, we recommend further study and research.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Example 1: Predicting stock prices} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stock prices are notoriously difficult to predict, but regression analysis can be a useful tool for identifying trends and making informed predictions.
    \item One approach to predicting stock prices using regression is to analyze historical price data and identify patterns and correlations that can be used to develop a predictive model.
    \item Factors that may influence stock prices include company financials, industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, and market sentiment, among others.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example 2: Predicting housing prices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Another common application of regression analysis is predicting housing prices, which can be useful for homebuyers, real estate investors, and other stakeholders.
    \item Factors that may influence housing prices include location, property size and condition, local market conditions, and economic trends, among others.
    \item Regression models for predicting housing prices may incorporate multiple variables and may require careful data preprocessing and model selection to ensure accurate and reliable results.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In this section, we briefly discussed two real-world problems where regression analysis can be applied: predicting stock prices and predicting housing prices.
    \item While regression can be a useful tool for making predictions and identifying trends in complex datasets, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to carefully consider data quality, model selection, and other factors that can affect the accuracy and reliability of results.
    \item If you are interested in learning more about these topics or applying regression to other real-world problems, we recommend further study and research to develop your skills and intuition.
